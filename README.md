Protoc compiler Dart plugin
===========================

This application provides a plugin for protoc compiler which
generates pure Dart library to deal with protobufs.

Please, do not forget that generated libraries depend on runtime
support library which can be found [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/protobuf).

Hacking
-------

So far to hack on the library the main thing you should be aware of is how
to run unittests.  The easiest way would be to use DartEditor and run
**all_tests.dart** file which is the whole suite.

If you'd like to run test from command line, please, do not pass proper
package root.
